Hello! I am Akshatha, a final year Master's student at the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS)](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru.

## My Background
I received my B.Tech. (Honours) degree in [Chemical Engineering](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/department-list/chemical.html) (with a minor specialisation in Fundamentals of Computing) from [Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html), Manipal, Karnataka, in 2023.  

I am pursuing an M.Tech. (Course) Degree in [Computational and Data Science](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/). Along with coursework, I am currently working on my Master's dissertation project in the [Biomolecular Computation Lab](http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/) under [Professor Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/dpal/).

## My Research Interests
While exploring various domains such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, process modelling and simulation during my Bachelor's, I was intrigued by the intricacies of proteins and their incredible potential as biocatalysts, and decided to dive deeper! Currently, my work revolves around evaluating the performance of various computational models (called force fields) in predicting the structure and dynamics of different protein folds in water, comparing results with extensive solution NMR data. Understanding the effects of force field parameters on various protein architectures and secondary structures can help us optimise force fields in a modular manner to represent protein behaviour more accurately.   

I am also interested in the broader aspects of green chemistry and the intersection of computational methods and chemical engineering principles. My Bachelor's project (Advisor: Dr Anoop Kishore V) explored the utility of a class of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as environmentally friendly alternatives to organic solvents for asphaltene aggregation and separation, combining insights from experiments and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. We also computationally simulated the effect of these solvents on lysozyme stability using various combinations of hydrogen bond donors. We found that lysozyme assumed a relatively stable structure in polyol-based DESs, expanding the scope of solvents that could potentially stabilise proteins.
