Hello! I am Akshatha, an incoming PhD student in Chemistry at Stony Brook University, NY this fall. 

## My Background

I received my B.Tech. (Honours) degree in [Chemical Engineering](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/department-list/chemical.html) (with a minor specialisation in Fundamentals of Computing) from [Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html), Manipal, Karnataka, in 2023.  

I just completed my M.Tech. (Course) Degree in [Computational and Data Science](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) in June 2025. I did my Master's dissertation project in the [Biomolecular Computation Lab](http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/) under [Professor Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/dpal/).

## My Research Interests

My research interests are diverse and have evolved over time. My background in chemical engineering and data science has given me an ample set of intriguing problem statements to tackle! Broadly, I am interested in green chemistry and molecular simulations, and have explored various areas including nanotechnology, interfacial science, and protein simulations till date.

During my undergrad, I came across simulation techniques to model various systems, ranging from asphaltenes to proteins. In a two-part study, I looked at various applications of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as asphaltene separating agents, and as solvents for lysozyme stability. I took various Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) with varying hydrogen bond donors as test solvents in both cases. As I delved further into the field during my Master's, I discovered more of the computational aspects of statistical thermodynamics, bioinformatics, and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, how force fields were developed and optimised, their drawbacks and how they could be improved further.

My Master's dissertation revolved around evaluating the performance of conventional force fields in predicting the structure and dynamics of different protein folds in water, comparing results with extensive solution NMR data. Understanding the effects of force field parameters on various protein architectures and secondary structures could eventually help us optimise force fields in a modular (fold-based) manner to represent protein behaviour more accurately, and help us design more efficient drug candidates, stable biocatalysts, and optimise protein designs for novel applications!
