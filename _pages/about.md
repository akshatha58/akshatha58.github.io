Hello! I am Akshatha, a final year Master's student at the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS)](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru.

## My Background
I received my B.Tech. (Honours) degree in [Chemical Engineering](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/department-list/chemical.html) (with a minor specialisation in Fundamentals of Computing) from [Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html), Manipal, Karnataka, in 2023.  

I am pursuing an M.Tech. (Course) Degree in [Computational and Data Science](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/). Along with coursework, I am currently working on my Master's dissertation project in the [Biomolecular Computation Lab](http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/) under [Professor Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/dpal/).

## My Research Interests
I am interested in green chemistry and the intersection of computational methods and structural biology. While exploring various domains such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, process modelling and simulation during my undergrad, I was intrigued by the intricacies of proteins and their incredible potential as biocatalysts, and decided to dive deeper!

I came across simulation techniques to model protein systems and studied how protein stability was affected in various solvent environments, such as Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs). As I delved further into the field during my master's, I discovered more of the computational aspects of statistical thermodynamics, bioinformatics, and molecular simulations, how force fields were developed and optimised, their drawbacks and how they could be improved further.

Currently, my work revolves around evaluating the performance of conventional force fields in predicting the structure and dynamics of different protein folds in water, comparing results with extensive solution NMR data. Understanding the effects of force field parameters on various protein architectures and secondary structures can help us optimise force fields in a modular (fold-based) manner to represent protein behaviour more accurately.
