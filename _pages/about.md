Hello! I am Akshatha, a final year Master's student at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru. I am pursuing an M.Tech. Degree in [Computational and Data Science](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/). Along with coursework, I am currently working on my Master's dissertation project in the [Biomolecular Computation Lab](http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/) under [Professor Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/dpal/). 

## My Research Interests
My research interests lie in protein structure and conformations. Currently, my work revolves around evaluating the performance of various computational models (called force fields) in predicting the structure and dynamics of different protein folds in water, comparing results with extensive solution NMR data. Understanding the effects of force field parameters on various protein architectures and secondary structures can help us fine-tune force fields in a modular manner to represent protein behaviour more accurately.
