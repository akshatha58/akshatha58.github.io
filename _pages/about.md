Hello! I am Akshatha. I am from Karnataka, India, and an incoming PhD student in Chemistry at [Stony Brook University, NY](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) this Fall. 

## My Academic Background

I received my B.Tech. (Honours) degree in [Chemical Engineering](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/department-list/chemical.html) (with a minor specialisation in Fundamentals of Computing) from [Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html), Manipal, Karnataka, in 2023.  

I recently completed my M.Tech. (Course) degree in [Computational and Data Science](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) in June 2025. I did my Master's dissertation project in the [Biomolecular Computation Lab](http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/) under [Professor Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/dpal/).

## My Research Interests

My research interests are diverse and evolve over time. My background in chemical engineering and data science has given me an ample set of intriguing problem statements to tackle! 

Broadly, I am interested in interfacial science and molecular simulations. I've explored various areas including nanotechnology, asphaltene separation and protein simulations till date, gradually shifting from the experimental to the theoretical realm. 

Feel free to check out my [projects](https://akshatha58.github.io/year-archive/) and [publications](https://akshatha58.github.io/publications/) for more academic info!

## My Hobbies

I am trained in Indian classical music, and have been playing the Carntatic violin for eleven years now.  I enjoy reading novels and jamming with fellow musicians, irrespective of genre. I also dabble in zentangle and mandala art (check out my [portfolio](https://www.behance.net/akshatha_hebbar))!
