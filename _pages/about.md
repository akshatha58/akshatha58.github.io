Hello! I am Akshatha, a final year Master's student at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru. I am pursuing an M.Tech. Degree in [Computational and Data Science](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/). Along with coursework, I am currently working on my Master's dissertation project in the [Biomolecular Computation Lab](http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/) under [Professor Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/dpal/). 

## My Research Interests
I am interested in protein structure and conformations, and my current work revolves around understanding the performance of various computational protein models called force fields in predicting protein structure and dynamics.
