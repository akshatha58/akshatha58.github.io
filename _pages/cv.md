[CV (Last modified: 19 July 2025)](CV.pdf)

Education
======

* **B.Tech. (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology Manipal (2023)**
  * Dissertation Title: “_Applications of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES): Experimental Investigations and Atomistic Insights Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations_”
  
  Undergraduate was an exploration phase, where I did literature reviews on topics in bioactive compounds, biocatalysts, and nanotechnology.

  Process modelling, simulation and control intrigued me, and I opted for an honours by taking additional subjects in numerical methods, optimisation of chemical processes and advanced control theory. I did a minor specialisation in Computing Fundamentals (python). 

  During my senior year in undergrad, I came across molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques to model various systems, ranging from asphaltenes to proteins. In a two-part study, I looked at various applications of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as asphaltene separating agents, and as solvents for lysozyme stability. 

  
* **M.Tech. in Computational and Data Science, Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru (2025)**
  * Dissertation Title: “_Evaluation of Force Fields for the Optimisation of Fold-based Modular Parameters for Globular Proteins_”
  
  I explored computational aspects of statistical thermodynamics, bioinformatics, and classical MD simulations, how force fields were developed and optimised, their drawbacks and how they could be improved further. 

  My Master's dissertation revolved around evaluating the performance of conventional force fields and water models. I compared the simulated behaviour (structure/dynamics) of different protein folds in water with observables from experimental solution NMR data.

  Such analyses could eventually help us optimise force fields in a modular (fold-based) manner to represent protein behaviour more accurately. More accurate models mean better design for potential drug candidates, stable biocatalysts, and more!

* **Incoming PhD student in Chemistry, Stony Brook University, SUNY (202?)**
  * I aim to explore topics in computational chemistry, quantum mechanics, and machine learning, and research on their applications in solving problems in interfacial science / biophysical / electrochemical systems. Let's see where this journey takes me!
