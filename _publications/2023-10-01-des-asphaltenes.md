Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are industrially promising and possess numerous applications in diverse areas such as metal processing, synthesis media, synthesis of nanoparticles, gas sequestration and many more. We investigated how various DESs (reline, ethaline and glyceline) affected the separation of pure asphaltene from organic solvents. Our experimental-simulations synergistic study showed that glyceline and reline efficiently separated asphaltenes from toluene and n-heptane, respectively.
