Carbon dots are zero-dimensional nanoparticles with properties such as fluorescence, size effects, and quantum confinement, which make them potential candidates for imaging, sensing and photocatalytic applications. This comprehensive review aims to provide a broader perspective of carbon dots by encapsulating the concepts of synthesis, characterisation and environmental applications (contaminant detection and photocatalysis), demerits and research gaps, and potential areas of improvement.
