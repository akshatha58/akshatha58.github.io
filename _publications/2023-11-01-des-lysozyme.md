excerpt: 'The ability of neat deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to influence protein structure and function has gained interest due to the unstable nature of enzymes or therapeutic proteins when exposed to thermal, chemical, or mechanical stresses when handled at an industrial scale. In this study, we simulated a model globular protein, lysozyme, in water and six choline chloride-based DES using molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural changes in various solvent environments, giving insights into the overall stability of lysozyme. We found that the flexibility and conformation of lysozyme depended on the nature of the hydrogen bond donor, and most DESs induced a rigid structure compared to water.'
